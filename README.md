# bootCamp[HUB]

Bootcamp graduates feel a little overwhelmed after they graduate. bootCampHub was created by us to help "green"
coders be part of a community that shares resources to improve coding, study concepts, and pose questions to the community.

## Getting started

Our website has both a register and login page for you to sign up or go back from where you left off. We provided a resources 
page to show videos with some coding or anything that you might not understand or need a step by step tutorial on. Also, we have a 
blog page for you to add articles that might interest/help other coders or look up previous articles saved. Lastly, we took the initiative 
to have a support bot on your side through our chat widget. Our chat widget is ultimately there to help fix techinical issues and soon 
able to talk to other coders.

## Deployment
Check it out here: https://cryptic-meadow-05044.herokuapp.com/

                            or
                            
                            
Clone our repo and use the sever localhost:3000 to start it up

## Problems
• heroku deployment issues

• github branch issues

• database not storing information and/or connecting to server and client side

## Solutions
• The heroku issued was solved by clearing out the proxy 504 error, refreshing the page, and making sure the client and server had the
right packages downloaded 



• The github branch issues were fixed with making sure we followed specific git commands in a specific order:

    git add -A
    
    git stash
    
    git checkout master
    
    git pull origin master
    
    git checkout YourBranchName
    
    git merge master
    
    git stash pop
